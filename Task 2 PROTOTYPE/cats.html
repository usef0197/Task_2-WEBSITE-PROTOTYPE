            <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently 
              the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, 
              care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being 
              of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

            <h3>Zero to Four Weeks</h3>
            <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) 
              directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate 
              is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed 
              the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight 
              appropriately include the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
                <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Four Weeks to One Year</h3>
            <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. 
              According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces 
              of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added 
              to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, 
              energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always 
              consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>

            <h3>One Year to Seven Years</h3>
            <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. 
              At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. 
              It is <b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. 
              Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking 
              throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>

            <h3>Seven Years and More</h3>
            <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. 
              Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you 
              are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") 
              and <b>not</b> just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, 
              of lesser quality proteins.</p>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <div class="row question-div">
              <div class="col">
                <h5>Why do cats sleep so much?</h5>
                <p>Cats sleep up to 16 hours per day in short increments that alternate between dozing and deep sleep. Some cats, especially seniors, can sleep up to 20 hours per day! One reason they sleep so much is because they are predators that use a lot of energy in small bursts when they hunt. They’re also crepuscular, which means they are most active at dawn and dusk so you’re more likely to see them sleeping throughout the day.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row question-div">
              <div class="col">
                <h5>Why do cats meow?</h5>
                <p>Most behavioral experts believe the meowing in cats is an attention-seeking behavior. Kittens meow to their mothers, likely as a way to get fed or get loved.
                    Since it worked as a kitten, adult cats likely continue the behavior with their humans, when they need something like food or companionship.</p>

            <div class="row question-div">
                <div class="col">
                  <h5>What Is the Best Food to Feed My Cat?</h5>
                  <p>Newborn Kittens (newborn to 4 months old). These diets are formulated to be the next step after weaning. Each is designed to provide high-quality nutrition during a period of growth and when activity is on the rise.
                    Junior Cats (7 months to 2 years). Diets designed for this life stage are made to match the high energy and activity level that young cats exude.
                    Prime Cats (3-6 years). Diets designed for this life stage meet maintenance calorie requirements for the adult cat.
                    Mature Cats (7-10 years). For this life stage, diets often switch from calorie rich to more conservative, and often focus on weight loss to help maintain a healthy body weight.
                    Senior Cats (11-14 years). This life stage can be where disease processes start to occur and diets may be designed to prevent weight gain and support the aging process.
                    Geriatric Cats (>15 years). Cats can become finicky as they age, so geriatric diets are formulated to help encourage eating. They can be lower in calories due to reduced activity and may have lower sodium concentrations.</p>

              <div class="col">
                <h5>How can I get my cat to lose weight?</h5>
                <p>Getting your cat to lose weight can be especially challenging, since you can’t just hitch them up to the leash and take them for longer walks every day, or play more catch in the backyard. But it’s definitely important and worth doing, since overweight cats are prone to the development of serious diseases such as diabetes.
                    Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they have to eat meat. We’ve altered the diet of housecats to be more convenient (and affordable). Commercial cat foods often contain large amounts of grains, which may predispose them to weight gain. Often if we increase the proportion of protein in the diet, by using special foods that are designed to accomplish this, we can stimulate metabolism and cause weight loss.</p>
