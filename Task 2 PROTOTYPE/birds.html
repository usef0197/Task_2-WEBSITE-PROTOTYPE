            <h3>Birds</h3>
            <p>Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly, there are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their relational needs and well-being. Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming bored. Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduced appetite</li>
                    <li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
                    <li>aggressive behavior</li>
                    <li>songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.</p>

                    <h5>When should I start and stop feeding birds?</h5>
                    <p>Seed-eating birds get their food from a variety of sources throughout a day, so what people provide is a convenient and easy source of food, but not necessary to help the species of birds that come to feeders. So, starting or stopping your feeding at any particular time of year won't have much of an impact on those birds. The only exception is if there is a bad snow or ice storm and natural food is buried for a period of time. In that event, the seed you put out could be life-saving for some birds. Some people choose to only feed in winter, but others feed year-round to attract them closer to enjoy them up close.</p>

                    <h5>How do birds replace their feathers?</h5>
                    <p>Birds replace their feathers by molting, the periodic shedding of old feathers and the growing of new ones. They do this one to three times each year, although different birds molt at different times of the year. Male goldfinches, for example, molt from a dull greenish yellow to bright yellow during spring. The periodic shedding of feathers serves many purposes. Feathers are incapable of further growth, and they may get worn down, broken, and faded over the year from normal wear and tear. Molting replaces these damaged feathers, and it also helps the males look attractive to females, which is why many molts take place during the mating season.</p>

                      <h5>What do birds eat?</h5>
                      <p>While some birds eat mostly insects, others, such as penguins, eat seafood. Beach birds, including seagulls, eat shellfish as well, but they are also scavengers that will eat food discarded by people. Some birds, such as ducks and geese, float on the water, dipping or diving to nibble on plants in oceans, lakes, and rivers. Others, such as raptors, swoop out of the sky to capture and eat small mammals, such as mice or rabbits. Some birds also prey on each other, such as large predatory birds including eagles and hawks. Many birds, including crows, jays, and magpies, eat the eggs and young of others. Individual bird species eat the foods from their local environment, but they have also developed physical characteristics that help them harvest food. Specific birds have adapted to feasting on plants as well, including algae, lichen, grass, seeds of all kinds, and much else.</p>
